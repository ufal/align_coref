BASIC INFO
============

* extracted from PCEDT 2.0, section 19
* ref selector => gold annotations
* anaphoric relations: grammatical corefernce, pronominal textual coreference

Our aim is to investigate how possible anaphoric expressions map from English to Czech and vice versa.

-------------------------------------

1) Extracting true anaphoric expressions and observing what t_lemmas and lemmas stand for that

-------------------------------------

2) Figure out rules to cover various types of anaphoric expressions (t_lemmas and lemmas from #1) without using the information on anaphoricity

a) en_perspron

Coverage:
* 852 occurrences
    - 90% (out of 946) English coreferential #PersProns
    - 38% (out of 2256) of all English coreferential

Observations:
* non-coreferential (those extracted by #2 but not in #1)
    en_perspron/non-coref.ref.sec19.list
* coreferential #PersProns, but not covered by en_perspron rule
    en_perspron/coref.non-ali.ref.sec19.list
    - most of them are unexpressed #PersPron
    - 1 ourselves => en_perspron does not cover ourselves???
        - OK, because it should cover only 3rd person pronouns

b) cs_relpron

Coverage:
* 529 occurrences
    - 99.8% (out of 530) Czech coreferential relative pronouns
    - 22% (2393) of all Czech coreferential

Observations:
* non-coreferential (those extracted by #2 but not in #1)
    cs_relpron/non-coref.ref.sec19.list
