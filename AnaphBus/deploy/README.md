# Summary

PAWS is a multilingual parallel treebank with tectogrammatical annotation and annotation of coreference.

# Introduction

PAWS (Parallel Anaphoric Wall Street Journal) is a multi-lingual parallel treebank with coreference annotation. It consists of English texts from the Wall Street Journal translated into Czech, Russian and Polish. In addition, the texts are syntactically parsed and word-aligned. PAWS is based on PCEDT 2.0 and continues the tradition of multilingual treebanks with coreference annotation. PAWS offers linguistic material that can be further leveraged in cross-lingual studies, especially on coreference.
