============ Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank - Russian translation (PCEDT-R)  version 0.5 =============
================================================================================================================

Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank - Russian translation (PCEDT-R) is a project of translating Prague 
Czech-English Dependency Treebank 2.0 (PCEDT 2.0) to Russian and annotating the Russian translations with emphasis 
on coreference and cross-lingual alignment of coreferential expressions. Cross-lingual comparison of coreference
means is the motivation that currently drives development of this corpus.

The current version 0.5 is a preliminary version, which contains (+ denotes new features):
    * complete PCEDT 2.0 documents "wsj_1900"-"wsj_1949"
    * Czech-English word alignment of coreferential expressions annotated manually mainly on the t-layer
    + Russian translations of the original English sentences
    + automatic tokenization, part-of-speech tagging and morphological analysis for Russian
    + automatic word alignment between all Czech and Russian words
    + manual alignment between Russian and the other two languages on possessive pronouns

The further text of the documentation gives more details on the individual features.

Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank 2.0
============================================

The Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank 2.0 (Hajič et al., 2011; Hajič et al., 2012) is a parallel treebank
of Czech and English comprising over 1.2 million running words in almost 50,000 sentences for each part. The treebank
contains texts from the entire Penn Treebank - Wall Street Journal section and its Czech translations. On top
of it, it includes three levels of rich linguistic annotation: morphological layer (part-of-speech tags, lemmas),
analytical layer (labeled dependency tree of shallow syntax), and tectogrammatical layer (labeled dependency tree
of deep syntax). The tectogrammatical tree consists only of the content words; however, new nodes unexpressed
in a surface representation may be introduced, e.g., elided subjects in Czech. The tectogrammatical layer is also 
the place where coreference relations are annotated, as it allows for annotating zero anaphora.

In version 0.5, only sections "wsj_1900"-"wsj_1949" have been used in PCEDT-R as a source data.

Manual Czech-English alignment of coreferential expressions
===========================================================

In the work of Novák and Nedoluzhko (2015), the authors conducted a thorough analysis of coreferential expressions
and their counterparts on English texts and their Czech translations. For this purpose, exactly the same sections
of PCEDT 2.0 as selected for this corpus ("wsj_1900"-"wsj_1949") were extended with manual annotation of coreferential
expressions' alignment. This annotation was later published in Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank 2.0 Coref
(Nedoluzhko et al., 2016; PCEDT 2.0 Coref) and now, it has been imported also to PCEDT-R.

The annotation of alignment focuses on central pronouns (embracing personal, possessive, and reflexive pronouns), 
relative pronouns, and anaphoric zeros. In fact, the set of targeted coreferential nodes have been selected automatically
using solely morpho-syntactic attributes, without the coreference information itself. Each such node is indicated 
by the is_align_coref attribute. 
The manual annotation of alignment has been conducted by two annotators. These alignment links are labeled by the 
coref_gold type. Missing coref_gold link connected to a node labeled by the is_align_coref attribute means
that the node has been inspected by a human annotator, who confirmed that it has no counterpart in the other language.

Russian translations of English sentences
=========================================

The original sentences in English have been translated to Russian. The translations have been provided by a single
human translator, whose native language is Russian.

The Russian translations have then been imported to corresponding places in the source PCEDT documents.

Automatic linguistic analysis of Russian texts
==============================================

The texts translated to Russian has been processed with automatic tools for linguistic analysis. The sentences
have been tokenized and the tokens have been assigned lemmas, part-of-speech tags, and morphological categories.
Whereas the tokenizer is based on simple rules, the latter three tasks have been completed using TreeTagger 
(Schmid, 1995) with a model trained on SynTagRus treebank (Boguslavsky, 2000). The analysis has been performed
by the Treex framework (Popel and Žabokrtský, 2010), encapsulating all the required tools.

Czech-Russian word alignment
============================

Word alignment between Czech and Russian have been collected by running a popular tool GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2000).
Running it only on the subset of PCEDT might result in low-quality output due to its small size (1k sentences). 
Therefore, we concatenated it with much bigger Czech-Russian data that consisted of:
    * UMC 0.1 Czech-English-Russian (88k sentences; https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/umc/cer/)
    * OpenSubtitles2012 (3434k sentences; http://opus.lingfil.uu.se/OpenSubtitles2012.php)
    * NewsCommentary (129k sentences; http://opus.lingfil.uu.se/News-Commentary.php)

After running GIZA++ on the whole portion of available data, we extracted the alignment links only from its
PCEDT part and imported it to the documents already containing the output of all the previous steps.

Manual Russian-English and Russian-Czech alignment of possessive pronouns
=========================================================================

Apart from already existing manual annotations of alignments between Czech and English coreferential expressions,
we aim at collecting the same between Russian and the other two languages. As Russian texts have no tectogrammatical
representation in version 0.5, Czech-English manual alignments represented on the other hand mainly on the tectogrammatical
layer needed to be projected to the analytical layer, which is much closer to the surface representation.

We started with collecting Czech-English-Russian alignments of possessive pronouns in the current version. For English 
and Czech possessive pronouns, it was sufficient to fill in possible Russian counterparts in addition to already 
annotated Czech/English counterparts. Next, it was necessary to find English and Czech counterparts of Russian 
possessive pronouns that had not been covered in the previous step. Manual annotation of alignment was collected 
by a single annotator, who can speak all the three languages (her native language is Russian), by post-editing the output 
of the automatic Czech-Russian aligned obtained by GIZA++.

Known issues
============

Some of the Russian translations needed to be corrected while collecting manual annotations of English possessive
pronouns' alignments. Out of 1127 English sentences, 205 contain a possessive pronoun, out of which 46 were 
re-translated. The fact that the only corrected translation were those containing an English possessive pronoun
gives rise to a suspicion that statistics collected on such translations may be biased.

Future work
===========

PCEDT-R is planned to be extended in two directions:
    1) Add manual annotation of coreferential relations in Russian. As prerequisite, a tectogrammatical structure
       is required. This will be obtained by automatic means and subsequent manual post-editing where necessary.
    2) Manual annotation of alignment between coreferential expressions should be extended to Russian also for
       the other expressions than possessive pronouns.
Extending the corpus by including more texts from PCEDT is not expected even in a long-term plan.
