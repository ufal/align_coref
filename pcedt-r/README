Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank 2.0 - Russian translation (PCEDT-R)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- a data collection of some of the original PCEDT 2.0 documents translated to Russian
- the main purpose of this dataset is to provide data for cross-lingual comparison
  of coreferential expressions
- scripts to create the dataset can be found on GitHub: https://github.com/ufal/align_coref

Data creation pipeline:
    Input: a subset of PCEDT 2.0 - documents wsj_1900-49
    Output: PCEDT-R
    A) Translate English sentences to Russian
        - manual translation of English sentences to Russian
        - provided by a single translator (Russian = native language)
    B) Align Russian translations with PCEDT documents automatically both on sentence
       and word level; provide automatic morphological analysis of Russian sentences
        - fully automatic processing using Treex framework and supporting scripts
        - pipeline stored in the GitHub repository, directory: "/ru_cs_align"
        - Processing steps:
            1) Czech translations from the input data and Russian translations collected
               in stage A were merged with the following data:
                * UMC 0.1 Czech-English-Russian (https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/umc/cer/)
                * OpenSubtitles2012 (http://opus.lingfil.uu.se/OpenSubtitles2012.php)
                * NewsCommentary (http://opus.lingfil.uu.se/News-Commentary.php)
            2) aligned Czech-Russian sentences from step 1 were aligned on a word level
               using GIZA++
            3) Russian translated sentences were imported to the input documents,
               so that the resulting English-Czech-Russian documents are aligned
               on the sentence level
            4) Russian part of the documents were tokenized and tagged with part-of-speech
               tags and morphologic features
            5) word alignments produced for the input data and the Russian translations in 
               step 2 were imported to the documents from step 4 
    C) Add manual word alignment for coreferential expressions
        - English-Czech manual alignment for sections wsj_1900-49 coreferential expressions 
          has been already added in Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank 2.0 Coref
          (http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pcedt2.0-coref)
        - here, we also add word alignment with Russian, particularly for Czech, English,
          and Russian possessive pronouns
        - processing steps consist of alternating export of current alignment to the "ali_annot"
          format designed for fast manual annotation of word alignment, and import of manual
          annotation back to the documents
        - the processing pipeline is ready to be used for any number of aligned languages
        - pipeline stored in the GitHub repository in the directory: "/pcedt-r" 

Known issues:
- some of the translations provided in stage A needed to be corrected while working
  on manual alignment of English possessive pronouns in stage C
    - out of 1127 English sentences, 205 contain a possessive pronoun, out of which 46 were re-translated
    - the fact that the only corrected translation were those containing an English possessive pronoun
      gives rise to a suspicion that the translations may be biased
