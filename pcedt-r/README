================================================================================================================

Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank - Russian translation (PCEDT-R) is a project of translating Prague 
Czech-English Dependency Treebank 2.0 (PCEDT 2.0) to Russian and annotating the Russian translations with emphasis 
on coreference and cross-lingual alignment of coreferential expressions. Cross-lingual comparison of coreference
means is currently the purpose that drives development of this corpus.

The current version 0.5 is a preliminary version, which contains (+ denotes new features):
    * complete PCEDT 2.0 documents "wsj_1900"-"wsj_1949"
    * Czech-English word alignment of coreferential expressions annotated manually mainly on the t-layer
    + Russian translations of the original English sentences
    + automatic tokenization, part-of-speech tagging and morphological analysis for Russian
    + automatic word alignment between all Czech and Russian words
    + manual alignment between Russian and the other two languages on possessive pronouns
- scripts to create the dataset can be found on GitHub: https://github.com/ufal/align_coref
